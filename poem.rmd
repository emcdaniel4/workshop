## Last Verse
For all the remaining seasons of my life on earth,    
There'll be days I'll miss your merriment and mirth,    
And sometimes I'll sadly long for all the yesterdays;    
Missing our chats and your gentle understanding ways.    
Yet, the lessons of kindness and love you taught me,    
And the good things in life you've helped me to see;    
Linger as lasting gifts that comfort and will sustain,    
Until I journey to that peaceful shore and see you again.
